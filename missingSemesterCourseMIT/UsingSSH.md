Remote Machines
===============

It has become more and more common for programmers to use remote servers in their everyday work. If you need to use remote servers in order to deploy backend software or you need a server with higher computational capabilities, you will end up using a Secure Shell (SSH). As with most tools covered, SSH is highly configurable so it is worth learning about it.

To `ssh` into a server you execute a command as follows

```
ssh foo@bar.mit.edu
```

Here we are trying to ssh as user `foo` in server `bar.mit.edu`. The server can be specified with a URL (like `bar.mit.edu`) or an IP (something like `foobar@192.168.1.42`). Later we will see that if we modify ssh config file you can access just using something like `ssh bar`.

Executing commands
------------------

An often overlooked feature of `ssh` is the ability to run commands directly. `ssh foobar@server ls` will execute `ls` in the home folder of foobar. It works with pipes, so `ssh foobar@server ls | grep PATTERN` will grep locally the remote output of `ls` and `ls | ssh foobar@server grep PATTERN` will grep remotely the local output of `ls`.

SSH Keys
--------

Key-based authentication exploits public-key cryptography to prove to the server that the client owns the secret private key without revealing the key. This way you do not need to reenter your password every time. Nevertheless, the private key (often `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and more recently `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) is effectively your password, so treat it like so.

### Key generation

To generate a pair you can run [`ssh-keygen`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh-keygen.1.html).

```
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

You should choose a passphrase, to avoid someone who gets hold of your private key to access authorized servers. Use [`ssh-agent`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh-agent.1.html) or [`gpg-agent`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/gpg-agent) so you do not have to type your passphrase every time.

If you have ever configured pushing to GitHub using SSH keys, then you have probably done the steps outlined [here](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) and have a valid key pair already. To check if you have a passphrase and validate it you can run `ssh-keygen -y -f /path/to/key`.

### Key based authentication

`ssh` will look into `.ssh/authorized_keys` to determine which clients it should let in. To copy a public key over you can use:

```
cat .ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh foobar@remote 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
```

A simpler solution can be achieved with `ssh-copy-id` where available:

```
ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_ed25519.pub foobar@remote
```

Copying files over SSH
----------------------

There are many ways to copy files over ssh:

-   `ssh+tee`, the simplest is to use `ssh` command execution and STDIN input by doing `cat localfile | ssh remote_server tee serverfile`. Recall that [`tee`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tee.1.html) writes the output from STDIN into a file.
-   [`scp`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/scp.1.html) when copying large amounts of files/directories, the secure copy `scp` command is more convenient since it can easily recurse over paths. The syntax is `scp path/to/local_file remote_host:path/to/remote_file`
-   [`rsync`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rsync.1.html) improves upon `scp` by detecting identical files in local and remote, and preventing copying them again. It also provides more fine grained control over symlinks, permissions and has extra features like the `--partial` flag that can resume from a previously interrupted copy. `rsync` has a similar syntax to `scp`.

Port Forwarding
---------------

In many scenarios you will run into software that listens to specific ports in the machine. When this happens in your local machine you can type `localhost:PORT` or `127.0.0.1:PORT`, but what do you do with a remote server that does not have its ports directly available through the network/internet?.

This is called *port forwarding* and it comes in two flavors: Local Port Forwarding and Remote Port Forwarding (see the pictures for more details, credit of the pictures from [this StackOverflow post](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/115897/whats-ssh-port-forwarding-and-whats-the-difference-between-ssh-local-and-remot)).

**Local Port Forwarding**![Local Port Forwarding](https://i.stack.imgur.com/a28N8.png%C2%A0 "Local Port Forwarding")

**Remote Port Forwarding**![Remote Port Forwarding](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4iK3b.png%C2%A0 "Remote Port Forwarding")

The most common scenario is local port forwarding, where a service in the remote machine listens in a port and you want to link a port in your local machine to forward to the remote port. For example, if we execute `jupyter notebook` in the remote server that listens to the port `8888`. Thus, to forward that to the local port `9999`, we would do `ssh -L 9999:localhost:8888 foobar@remote_server` and then navigate to `locahost:9999` in our local machine.

SSH Configuration
-----------------

We have covered many many arguments that we can pass. A tempting alternative is to create shell aliases that look like

```
alias my_server="ssh -i ~/.id_ed25519 --port 2222 -L 9999:localhost:8888 foobar@remote_server

```

However, there is a better alternative using `~/.ssh/config`.

```
Host vm
    User foobar
    HostName 172.16.174.141
    Port 2222
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    LocalForward 9999 localhost:8888

# Configs can also take wildcards
Host *.mit.edu
    User foobaz

```

An additional advantage of using the `~/.ssh/config` file over aliases is that other programs like `scp`, `rsync`, `mosh`, &c are able to read it as well and convert the settings into the corresponding flags.

Note that the `~/.ssh/config` file can be considered a dotfile, and in general it is fine for it to be included with the rest of your dotfiles. However, if you make it public, think about the information that you are potentially providing strangers on the internet: addresses of your servers, users, open ports, &c. This may facilitate some types of attacks so be thoughtful about sharing your SSH configuration.

Server side configuration is usually specified in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Here you can make changes like disabling password authentication, changing ssh ports, enabling X11 forwarding, &c. You can specify config settings on a per user basis.

Miscellaneous
-------------

A common pain when connecting to a remote server are disconnections due to shutting down/sleeping your computer or changing a network. Moreover if one has a connection with significant lag using ssh can become quite frustrating. [Mosh](https://mosh.org/), the mobile shell, improves upon ssh, allowing roaming connections, intermittent connectivity and providing intelligent local echo.

Sometimes it is convenient to mount a remote folder. [sshfs](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) can mount a folder on a remote server locally, and then you can use a local editor.
